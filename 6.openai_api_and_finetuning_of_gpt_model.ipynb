It usually features the top eight teams in One Day Internationals (ODIs).\n","   \n","2. **Frequency**: The Champions Trophy was held irregularly, approximately every 2-4 years, although its schedule changed over time. The last edition was held in 2017, and subsequent tournaments have been proposed but not confirmed.\n","\n","3. **Duration**: The tournament is shorter in duration than the World Cup, usually lasting about two weeks. It features group stages followed by knockout rounds.\n","\n","4. **Significance**: While prestigious, the Champions Trophy is generally considered less significant than the World Cup.\n","\n","### Cricket World Cup:\n","1. **Format**: The Cricket World Cup is a longer and larger tournament, typically featuring 10 to 14 teams (depending on the format in that particular edition). It includes a group stage followed by knockout rounds and is played in ODIs.\n","\n","2. **Frequency**: The ICC Cricket World Cup is held approximately every four years. The tournament began in 1975 and has had numerous editions since.\n","\n","3. **Duration**: The World Cup usually lasts about a month or more, given the larger number of teams and matches involved.\n","\n","4. **Significance**: The World Cup is regarded as the pinnacle event in ODI cricket, and winning it is considered the highest achievement in the format.\n","\n","### Summary:\n","- The **Champions Trophy** is shorter and involves fewer teams, serving as a significant but not the ultimate competition. \n","- The **World Cup** is larger, longer, and is the marquee event in the cricketing calendar, representing the ultimate challenge for ODI teams.\n","\n","In recent years, the future of the Champions Trophy has been in question, with discussions about its relevance compared to other formats and tournaments.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import json\n","\n","with open(\"/content/test.jsonl\",\"r\",encoding=\"utf-8\") as file:\n","  data=[json.loads(line) for line in file]"],"metadata":{"id":"DqzG8HKeX4WQ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1743009242794,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":17,"user":{"displayName":"Mohan DS","userId":"05181729263002066506"}}},"execution_count":8,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["data"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"_Ff66MFHceZR","outputId":"ba7f8d0e-85b3-4412-a6ed-cece7567c011","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1743009244095,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":21,"user":{"displayName":"Mohan DS","userId":"05181729263002066506"}}},"execution_count":9,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["[{'messages': [{'role': 'system',\n","    'content': 'You are a customer support agent for a smartphone company whose primary goal is to help users with issues they are experiencing with their smartphones.
