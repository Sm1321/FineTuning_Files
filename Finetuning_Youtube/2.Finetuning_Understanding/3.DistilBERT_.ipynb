    "## 1. What Is Knowledge Distillation?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Knowledge distillation** is a method for compressing a large, powerful model (**teacher**) into a smaller, faster model (**student**) so it performs nearly as well but is much more efficient for deployment.\n",
    "- In NLP, this means turning big models (like BERT, LLaMA, GPT family) into smaller, practical versions (like DistilBERT).\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Large models are accurate but slow and resource-intensive**—not ideal for mobile, web, or real-time applications.\n",
    "- Distillation lets you:  \n",
    "    - Cut down inference time and memory usage,\n",
    "    - Use models on edge devices or in production with limited compute,\n",
    "    - Retain much of the original model’s accuracy.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Step 1:** Train a large teacher model on your target task.\n",
    "- **Step 2:** Initialize a compact student model (often an architecture with fewer layers or parameters).\n",
    "- **Step 3:** Train the student to mimic the teacher by:\n",
    "    - Learning not just the hard targets (ground-truth labels),  \n",
    "    - But also mimicking the teacher’s *soft outputs* (probabilities over all possible classes, i.e., logits or soft labels).\n",
    "- **Loss Function:** Usually a weighted sum of:\n",
    "    - Regular task loss (e.g., cross-entropy with true labels)\n",
    "    - Distillation loss (like Kullback-Leibler divergence between teacher and student softmax outputs).\n",

    "1. **Load teacher model:** E.g., a full BERT or LLaMA model fine-tuned for your task.\n",
    "2. **Prepare student model:** A smaller model, possibly with fewer layers.\n",
    "3. **Define custom training loop or loss using your deep learning framework (like PyTorch or Hugging Face Transformers):**\n",
    "    - For each batch, compute predictions from both teacher and student.\n",
    "    - Combine ground-truth loss and distillation loss.\n",
    "    - Backpropagate only on the student.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 6. Key Benefits and Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Memory & Speed:** The distilled student model runs much faster, uses less RAM and compute.\n",
    "- **Deployment:** Easy to deploy in real-world settings with hardware constraints.\n",
    "- **Flexibility:** You can distill into various architectures (not just smaller copies of teacher).\n",

    "## 7. Real-World Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mobile and web applications** needing fast inference.\n",
    "- **Cloud cost reduction** in production-serving architectures.\n",
    "- **Benchmark models in competitions and industry:** Distilled models are often winners due to their efficiency.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Key Points to Remember\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Distillation is not fine-tuning or pretraining**—it is a unique compression and knowledge-transfer process.\n",
    "- Distillation **can be applied after full pretraining and/or task-specific fine-tuning** of the teacher.\n",
    "- It’s frequently combined with other efficiency techniques (e.g., quantization, pruning) for maximum effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. Further Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "- Models like DistilBERT, TinyBERT, MobileBERT are all real-world distillation examples.\n",
    "- The next part of the lecture/video often explores **quantization**—another compression technique, and how to combine it with distillation for even smaller models.\n",
